# Meact

Meact is a lightweight and simplified version of React, designed to provide a basic understanding of how React works under the hood. It follows a similar component-based architecture and implements a subset of React's features.

This project is inspired by [Didact](https://github.com/pomber/didact), a minimal implementation of React created by Rodolfo Pombeiro. Meact builds upon the concepts and ideas presented in Didact, with some modifications and enhancements.

## Features

- **Virtual DOM**: Meact uses a virtual DOM implementation to efficiently update and render components.
- **JSX Support**: Meact supports JSX syntax, allowing you to write components using familiar JSX syntax.
- **Functional Components**: Meact supports functional components, which are lightweight and easy to use.
- **useState Hook**: Meact provides a simplified version of the `useState` hook to manage component state.
- **useEffect Hook**: Meact provides a simplified version of the `useEffect` hook to manage component side effects.
- **map Function**: Meact provides a simplified version of the `map` function to render lists of components.
- **Reconciliation**: Meact performs a diffing algorithm to efficiently update the DOM based on component changes.
